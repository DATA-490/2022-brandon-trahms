* **Major**: B.S. of Computer Science
* **Year**: 2022

# Type of project

Machine Learning Research Project

# Purpose (including intended audience)

The project is directed at other those with a computer vision and machine learning background as well as those who may just use the tools with out the related academic work. It's aim is to further our understanding of facial recognition models and their robustness against GANS.

# Explanation of files

* `<Trainer.ipynb>` - Notebook where the Generator is instantiated, trianed, and then saved.
* `<Tester.ipynb>` - Notebook where saved Generators and images can we tested against facial recognition models.
* `<Helper.py>` - Script with various helper functions which assist training and testing.
    
# Completion status

- [ ] Investigate More Identities
- [ ] Investigate More Compact GANs
- [ ] Investigate Methods of Fooling Black Box Models
- [ ] Investigate Fooling Facial Detection Models
